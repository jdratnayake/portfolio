            <a href="#">EMvidence</a> - EMvidence is a software tool designed to
            extract forensic insights from electromagnetic (EM) signals emitted
            by IoT devices. It enables users to capture the EM signals emitted
            by the device being tested using Software-defined Radio (SDR)
            hardware named HackRF One. Users can preprocess and analyze these
            signals using EMvidence's various modules to gain an understanding
            of the tested IoT devices. Additionally, users have the flexibility
            to develop their own third-party modules tailored to their specific
            needs, promoting the open-source development of preprocessing and
            analysis plugins that enhance the overall capability of the software
            tool. EMvidence provides an alternative forensic solution for IoT
            devices that was found in an investigation instead of classical and
            invasive digital forensic techniques.

            <a href="#">ALec</a> - ALec is a mobile and web application that
            addresses the challenges of low student engagement and interaction
            in the classroom. It allows lecturers to give small quizzes during
            lectures, which students can answer via their smartphones, giving
            the lecturer a real-time understanding of students' knowledge and
            understanding of the lecture. Students can also ask questions
            anonymously through the app, increasing participation and
            interaction in class. The app provides a platform for
            self-evaluation through a leaderboard and review system, helping
            students to pay closer attention to course content. ALec strengthens
            the interaction between lecturers and students, increasing
            efficiency and popularity for both parties, and ultimately improving
            the overall learning experience.
