          EMvidence is a software tool designed to extract forensic insights
          from electromagnetic (EM) signals emitted by IoT devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enables users to capture EM signals from the device being tested using
          Software-defined Radio (SDR) hardware, specifically the HackRF One.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users can preprocess and analyze the captured EM signals using various
          modules within EMvidence to gain insights into the tested IoT devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Allows users to develop third-party modules tailored to their specific
          needs, fostering open-source development of preprocessing and analysis
          plugins.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provides an alternative forensic solution for IoT devices found in
          investigations, as opposed to traditional and invasive digital
          forensic techniques.
        </li>
        <li><b>Contribution:</b> EM signal analysis modules.</li>

          ALec is a mobile and web application that addresses the challenges of
          low student engagement and interaction in the classroom.
        </li>
        <li>
          It allows lecturers to give small quizzes during lectures, which
          students can answer via their smartphones, giving the lecturer a
          real-time understanding of students' knowledge and understanding of
          the lecture.
        </li>
        <li>
          Students can also ask questions anonymously through the app,
          increasing participation and interaction in class.
        </li>
        <li>
          The app provides a platform for self-evaluation through a leaderboard
          and review system, helping students to pay closer attention to course
          content.

        <li>
          ALec strengthens the interaction between lecturers and students,
          increasing efficiency and popularity for both parties, and ultimately
          improving the overall learning experience.
