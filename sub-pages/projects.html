        <li>
          Retrieves data from approximately 100 sources, supporting both
          automatic downloads and manual uploads.
        </li>

        <li>
          Converts extracted data into a standardized format, applying cleaning
          and validation mechanisms to ensure quality. Uses predefined templates
          to reduce coding effort and improve maintainability in the
          transformation phase.
        </li>

        <li>
          Enhances performance by skipping unchanged files using hash
          comparisons, reducing redundant computations.
        </li>

        <li>
          Merges transformed data, applies additional processing, and uploads
          the final output to a client-specified location.
